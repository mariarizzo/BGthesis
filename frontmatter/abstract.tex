	There is no escape. Don't make me destroy you.
	pauses Luke, you do not yet realize your importance.

	and I will complete your training. With our combined
	strength, we can end this destructive conflict and
	bring order to the galaxy.

	I'll never join you!
Darth Vader:
	If you only knew the *power* of the dark side. Obi-wan
	never told you what happened to your father.
Luke Skywalker:
	He told me enough! He told me *you* killed him.
Darth Vader:
	No. *I* am your father.
