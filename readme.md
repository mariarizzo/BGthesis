BGthesis is a template for a Bowling Green State University doctoral dissertation. 
It is equivalent to the version at github.com/clzirbel/BGSU-latex-templates,
except that the files are organized in folders (chapters, frontmatter, figures, documentation)
and the \input{} lines and including figures are revised accordingly.
